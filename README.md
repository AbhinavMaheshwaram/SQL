## How to Use This Repository

You can browse the different directories to find SQL scripts relevant to your interests. Each script (where applicable) will ideally be commented to explain its purpose and the logic behind the code.

If you find any of the scripts useful, feel free to adapt them for your own learning or projects. However, please give appropriate credit if you use significant portions of the code.
